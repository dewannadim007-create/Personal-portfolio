## About

I am a final-year Computer Science student specializing in **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning Architecture**. My research focuses on developing lightweight, efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for synthetic media detection in resource-constrained environments.

Currently, I am working on custom architectures for **Deepfake Detection**, aiming to improve accuracy while reducing computational overhead compared to traditional heavy transfer-learning models.

## Research & Projects

### **Deepfake vs. Real Image Detection**
*Proposed Lightweight CNN Architecture*

Developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network designed to detect artifacts in synthetic media. The model focuses on spatial inconsistencies often missed by traditional classifiers.

- **Objective**: Fight misinformation by detecting deepfakes with high efficiency.
- **Performance**: Achieved **91% - 98%** accuracy in preliminary tests.
- **Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV.
